# NookOS Experiments
 THIS IS AN OUTDATED VERSION OF NOOKOS
 
## Why is it outdated?
For short, I'm remaking it entirely in Rust.

For long: I'm remaking it entirely in Rust, because I've found enough documentation to do so, and because I wanna learn a new programming language. Also, I'll be trying to make a family/user-friendly OS.
