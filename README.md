# NookOS Experiments
 THIS IS AN OUTDATED VERSION OF NOOKOS
 
## Why is it outdated?
For short, I'm remaking it entirely in Rust.

For long: I'm remaking it entirely in Rust, because I've found enough documentation to do so, and because I wanna learn a new programming language. Also, I'll be trying to make a family/user-friendly OS.

## March 2022 update: What happens to this project and what happened to a lot of my repos?
For short: I deleted a lot of my repos that were forks and projects I abandonned three days after creating the repo. I'm keeping this repo up for the time being. I am maybe going to return to this project sometime in the future. Oh, and, forget Rust.
